# Movie Database Analysis

This project aims to analyze the MovieLens dataset using PostgreSQL database for data storage and analysis. The dataset contains 5-star ratings and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. It includes 100,000 ratings and 3,600 tag applications across 9,000 movies, created by 600 users between January 09, 1995, and September 24, 2018.

## Database

### Database Description

The PostgreSQL database schema used for this project consists of several tables to store different types of data:

- `ratings`: Contains information about user ratings for movies.
- `tags`: Stores user-generated metadata tags for movies.
- `movies`: Holds movie information including title, genres, and identifiers.
- `links`: Provides identifiers to link to other sources of movie data.

### Dataset Citation

To acknowledge the use of the MovieLens dataset in publications, please cite the following paper:

### Further Information

For more details about the MovieLens dataset and the GroupLens research group, visit the [MovieLens website](http://movielens.org) and the [GroupLens website](https://grouplens.org/).

### Database Access

The MovieLens dataset is not stored directly in this repository. You can download the dataset from the [GroupLens datasets page](https://grouplens.org/datasets/).

## Dockerized PostgreSQL

To simplify database setup, this project uses Docker to run a PostgreSQL container. The Dockerfile provided initializes a PostgreSQL database with the required schema and loads the MovieLens dataset.

### Docker Setup

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmydud/movie-database-analysis
```
3. Build the Docker image:
```bash 
docker build -t moviedb-postgres .
```
4. Run the PostgreSQL container:
```bash 
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name postgres-container -v /path/to/data/folder:/data moviedb-postgres
```

**Note**: Replace `/absolute/path/to/data/folder` with the absolute path to your folder containing CSV files.

This command will start a PostgreSQL container named moviedb-container and expose port 5432 for database access.
5. Access the PostgreSQL database using your preferred client (e.g., pgAdmin, DBeaver) with the following credentials:
- **Host:** localhost
- **Port:** 5432
- **Database:** moviedb
- **Username:** postgres
- **Password:** password

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Docker: To set up and run the PostgreSQL database container.
- PostgreSQL client: To interact with the database. You can use pgAdmin.
- Git: To clone the repository.
